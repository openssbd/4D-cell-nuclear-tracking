## Synopsis
(Updated 2019-08-13)
* The latest mlx live script files contain all the results/answers of the codes.
* For those who only want to browse the codes online without git clone or downloading the zip file, you can access the code in the M_filesFolder. 
* If you want to access the original files, you can click on the branch 2019-08-08 on github and download that zip file instead.

* This repository contains files and codes for a training course in "4D nuclear tracking and cell dynamics analysis" in summer 2019.
* The course and codes use MATLAB.
* The aim of this course is to introduce 4D cell tracking and cell dynamics analysis techniques for investigating dynamics of multicellular systems. 
* The course assumes that the audience do not have prior knowledge of programming. 
* It will introduce the use of the software package MATLAB and general scientific programming. 
* It will then introduce essential image processing techniques to segment 4D images, labelling interested regions and tracking them over time. 
* The course will also introduce the use of public database SSBD and to use the images and resources in SSBD for segmentation, tracking and analysis.
