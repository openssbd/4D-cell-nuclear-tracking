## Synopsis
* This repository contains files and codes for a training course in "4D nuclear tracking and cell dynamics analysis" in summer 2019.
* The course and codes use MATLAB.
* The aim of this course is to introduce 4D cell tracking and cell dynamics analysis techniques for investigating dynamics of multicellular systems. 
* The course assumes that the audience do not have prior knowledge of programming. 
* It will introduce the use of the software package MATLAB and general scientific programming. 
* It will then introduce essential image processing techniques to segment 4D images, labelling interested regions and tracking them over time. 
* The course will also introduce the use of public database SSBD and to use the images and resources in SSBD for segmentation, tracking and analysis.
